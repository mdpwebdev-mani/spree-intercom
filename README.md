   You can read more about access tokens [here](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/personal-access-tokens)

   > Please ensure this step is performed before running the rake task.

6. Run the rake task to add intercom id to your pre-existing users and move your users to Intercom.

  ```ruby
  bundle exec rake intercom:process_users
  ```

7. You need to specify the default url options in the specific environment files.  
   For example, you need to add this in production.rb

  ```ruby
  Rails.application.routes.default_url_options = { host: "mydomain.com", protocol: 'https' }
  ```

## Usage

1. If you have entered correct application id, and access token; AND have subscribed to Intercom's chat product [ message / inbox ], you should be able to see Intercom chat widget in your store.

   Please visit your Intercom admin panel to customise it as per your wish.

2. As soon as a user creates an account, or user updates his information [ name, phone ] is instantaneously uploaded on Intercom.

   As soon as the customer logs out of his account, his previous conversation is swiped off, to maintain customer's privacy.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_intercom/factories'
```
