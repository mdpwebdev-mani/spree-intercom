## Introduction

It is a spree wrapper for Intercom, by which you can directly install Intercom on your store, create and update customers on Intercom, chat with customers, and track his movements on your store, without any hassle.

We currently support Rails 5 and Spree > 3.1

3. Copy & run migrations

4. Run the rake task to add intercom id to your pre-existing users.
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rake intercom:process_users

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

3. As soon as a user creates an account, or user updates his information [ name, phone ] is instantaneously uploaded on Intercom.

4. You can engage with customers through the Intercom message widget.

   As soon as the customer logs out of his account, his previous conversation is swiped off, to maintain customer's privacy.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_intercom/factories'
```
